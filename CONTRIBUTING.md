## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites
 
This project should be built against Go 1.8 or newer.

Note that the public import path is `gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-evaluation.v1` (using the [`gopkg.in`](https://labix.org/gopkg.in) service as a simple way to pin to a major version). Since it does not use Go modules, and it references its own import path in imports between packages, this means that in order to build it you must check it out at `$GOPATH/src/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-evaluation.v1`-- not `$GOPATH/src/github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-evaluation`.

### Building

To build the project without running any tests:
```
make
```

If you wish to clean your working directory between builds, you can clean it by running:
```
make clean
```

To run the linter:
```
make lint
```

### Testing
 
To build and run all unit tests:
```
make test
```
