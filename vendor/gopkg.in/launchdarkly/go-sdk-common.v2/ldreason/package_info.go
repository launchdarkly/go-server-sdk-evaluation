// Package ldreason provides types that describe the outcome of a LaunchDarkly flag evaluation.
//
// You do not need to use these types to evaluate feature flags with the LaunchDarkly SDK. They are
// only required for the "detail" methods that allow you to determine whether the result of a flag
// evaluation was due to, for instance, user key targeting or a specific flag rule.
